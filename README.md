# Project Name 
TheNucleus

## Project Description
TheNucleus is a full-stack CRM platform designed to centralize customer data, case management, and service workflows in one unified system. It enables teams to track interactions, manage requests, and streamline operational processes through a scalable, API-driven architecture.

The backend of TheNucleus will be developed using Golang, chosen for its performance, concurrency support, and suitability for building scalable, API-driven systems. It will expose secure RESTful APIs to handle core functionalities such as user management, case lifecycle handling, workflow automation, and role-based access control.

The frontend will be built using React to deliver a responsive and intuitive user interface. React’s component-based architecture will be used to create modular views for dashboards, case lists, detailed records, and workflow interactions, ensuring maintainability and scalability as the platform evolves.

The project is being developed as a semester-long application following real-world software engineering and agile development practices, with a focus on clean code, extensibility, and separation of concerns between the frontend and backend layers.

-- As development progresses, additional features and enhancements will be incrementally introduced. --

-- The project description and feature set will be updated accordingly to reflect the evolving scope and capabilities of the application. --
